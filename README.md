◦ Developed a time series forecasting model to predict daily retail sales using Facebook Prophet on real-world transactional data.
<br>
◦ Performed data aggregation, preprocessing, and transformation to prepare sales data for modeling, including date formatting and trend analysis.
<br>
◦ Tuned model parameters such as seasonality mode, changepoint flexibility, and smoothing to handle real business patterns and irregular sales behavior.
<br>
◦ Implemented forecast evaluation using MAE and error analysis techniques (MAPE, SMAPE, clipping, filtering) to ensure robust accuracy reporting.
<br>
◦ Achieved a final Mean Absolute Error of ₹16,855, effectively modeling sales patterns with seasonal trends and delivering business-relevant forecasts.
<br>
◦ Documented the complete pipeline in a clean, reusable Google Colab notebook and published the project with a detailed README on GitHub for transparency.
